- Look at implementing any of these algorithms in a separate python file, only changing the process_array function
Best options to implement:
PID Controller with Centroid — smooth, reliable
Histogram-Based Centering — very fast, simple
Pure Pursuit — natural behavior for curves
Hough Transform — robust to noise
I can help implement any of these in a new file. Which one should we start with?

- Send Dr. C my webots learning resources

- Look at Udemy course in pytorch to help with transfer learning / genetic algorithms
    - Think of ways we could train models for genetic algorithms (X and Y, computer vision, etc...)
